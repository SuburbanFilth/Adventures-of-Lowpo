Physics System:
    ✔ GJK @done(19-03-18 19:22)
    ✔ Expanding Polytope Algorithm @done(19-03-18 19:22)
    ☐ Contact point from EPA
    ☐ Finish Collision detector implementation
    ☐ Fix the support map vectors that we are using to get the points used to create a minkowski point. (ExpandingPolytopeAlgorithm)
    ☐ Add enum for different type of dynamic types.
        We dont want animals and player to respond to physics forces as normal objects do
    ✘ Implement AABB -> Sphere Collision check @cancelled(19-03-17 16:48)

24.03.2019 - 26.03.2019:
    ☐ Document my GJK and EPA implementation;
    ☐ Getting contact point/s
        this is done with the help of the directions used to generate the support points for each convex object.
