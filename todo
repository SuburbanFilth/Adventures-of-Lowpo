Physics System:
    ☐ SAT - Gauss map
    ☐ Finish Collision detector implementation
    ☐ Fix the support map vectors that we are using to get the points used to create a minkowski point. (ExpandingPolytopeAlgorithm)
    ☐ Add enum for different type of dynamic types.
    We dont want animals and player to respond to physics forces as normal objects do

    Getting contact point/s
        this is done with the help of the directions used to generate the support points for each convex object.
